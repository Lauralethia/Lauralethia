My research focuses on exploring the formation of subjectivity and the factors that can alter this process. I am especially interested in the intersection of physiological mechanisms and cognitive experiences. To examine these topics, I use computational cognitive neuroscience tools to investigate how psychedelic drugs affect conscious subjective experience and to study how adolescent behavior stabilizes. I also enjoy working on cool projects with drugs between my main research tasks.
